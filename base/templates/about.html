		About Me
	</h1>
	<h2>
		The Basics
	</h2>
	<p>My name is Anthony Lancaster, but I go by Tony. I am a software engineer from the Richmond area. Currently, I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. I am studying to get my B.S. in computer science and I plan to graduate in May 2020.
	</p>
	<h2>
		But who am I really?
	</h2>
	<p>
		That aside, there are all kinds of fun things to know about me. Like anyone I have my passions and my joys and the things that make me quirky old me. I am a strong Christian and love serving others. I have a great love for cats, especially my very own 20 pounder George. I am a roller coaster enthusiast and have logged over 100 different roller coasters ridden, all across the east coast. I am a barista and honestly have an unecessary amount of knowledge about coffee. I like roller skating and have a dream of starting my own roller derby team. I am a musician and own too many instruments, but I keep collecting more. I have a mild obsession with broadway musicals. I am a bit of a nerd and love reading, playing video games, and even from time to time writing because I really love being emeressed in a compelling story. I really like light houses and find feats of human engineering to be enthrallign. All of that combines to make the six foot ball of chaotic quirky fun that is me.

	<h2>
		Early Life
	</h2>
	<p>
		I grew up in Chesterfield, Virginia on the south side of Virginia. I was raised by my mom and dad in a strong Christian household alongside my two older sisters. Many of my passions and joys started from a young age. My love of lighthouses stems from visits to Nags Head in the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a young child. I remember pushing my family to make long trips so that I could visit new lighthouses that I had never seen before. My roller coaster passion grew out of family visits to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Virginia. From there, I began travelling and visiting theme parks whenever and wherever I could, and now, I have ridden a total of 105 roller coasters. My love of music began when I started taking piano lessons at the age of seven and continued to grow as I joined concert band in middle school, and from there, joined more and more ensembles, learning more and more instruments. My passions for video games and reading were also essential parts of my childhood. I have always found it so easy to get lost in the world of imagination and truly enjoy letting my creative side take over.

	<h2>
		High School
	</h2>
	<p>
		High school was a time that began to shape the trajectory of my life. From a young age, I knew that I desired to be an engineer. Throughout my life, that meant several things such as a roller coaster engineer or a train engineer. Coming into high school, I had no clue what kind of engineer I wanted to be. I just knew that was my end goal, so logically, I wanted to go to the well known engineering school of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (or simply Virginia Tech). My middle sister, on the other hand, wanted to go to Tech's rival school, the University of Virginia (UVa). Being that UVa was the rival school of my dream school, I could not like it under any circumstances. My sister ended up being accepted at UVa and much to my despair, my mother forced me to come along to UVa's admitted students day. I went into the day, embittered about being in Charlottesville and even looked for every possible reason I had to dislike UVa. But by the end of that day, I had fallen in love and decided beyond a doubt, that the University of Virginia would be my home for my undergraduate career. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Much of the rest of my time in high school was spent preparing to get into UVa, taking way to many difficult class and trying to be a member of every club under the sun. Despite my tendency to overcommit, there were those few clubs that meant so much to me in time at Manchester High School. The Latin Club was probably my most enjoyed committment. I was a member of the executive board for three of my four years and I really cherished the friends and memories I had through it and will forever remember some basics of the Latin language. The show choir accompaniment band (aka show band) was my favorite ensemble and it reignited a love for music that had dwindled through the years and showed me what it was like to enjoy music again. I also blame show band for having a hand in my musical theater craze. My time in Boy Scouts of America Troop 2894 also was extremely impactful and gave me so many fantastic memories and friends as well as useful skills that I will forever remember.

		<p>
		 My highschool experience came to a close after what was both a short burst and an extremely long journey. By the grace of God, I was accepted into my dream school, and I began attending the University of Virginia in the Fall of 2016. BUt what engineering would I major in? Funny enough, during high school my family happened to have a movie night where we watched the Internship, a fictionalized movie about Google software interns. When the movie had ended, I was not sure why (as at that point I had never coded in my life), I decided that programming was the career path I would follow.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Undergraduate Years
	</h2>
	<p>
		My time as an undergrad was probably one of the most transformative experiences of my life. Through the provision of the Lord, the pressing insistance of my sister, and the blessings of Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, I was able to grow my faith in immeasurable ways during my four years at UVa. I had the blessing of taking on leadership within the fellowship and leading multiple small groups. Chi Alpha enabled me to missionally serve in as close as the city of Charlottesville in my own backyard to as far as the city of Granada in Spain. I learned far more about myself in this time than I ever envisioned being dropped off on that hot August day in 2016. During these four years, the Lord has placed so many friendships into my life that I am so thankful for and that have been so impactful on my life. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I also began to learn of my love for coffee craft during my time in college. After learning an excessive amount about the craft in a casual sense, I began my employment with Starbucks halfway through my second year. I learned far more throughout my time as a partner at Starbucks and learned so many valuable skills that I will carry with me. I have had the honor of working alongside two incredible teams (one in Charlottesville during the school year and one in Chesterfield during summer/winter breaks) and the people I have worked alongside have been some of the most incredible and loving partners I could ever have imagined to make my now two years there so amazing.

	<h2>
		What next?
	</h2>
	<p>
		May of 2020 brings my time at the University of Virginia to a close and I find myself in a distinct transitioning of seasons in my life. Currently, I am in the process of seeking a full time position in the software engineering / development field. That is the major question of what next that I am currently trying to answer, but that is only one of many. The thing that excites me the most about what next, is the certain freedom that graduating will bring. Instead of being bogged down in a tight schedule with work before class and then homework each night after class in addition to meetingsa and extracirriculars, I will have a little bit more free time to do the things I love. I look forward to being able to put more focus on my music skills. Additionally, I look forward to being able to improve my coding skills as well, by taking on new projects and learning things that I simply did not have time to learn in my undergraduate career. I love learning new things and I am excited to be able to have time to learn for fun. Maybe someday, I shall return to school in get a Masters in computer science or software engineering. There is so much in the air and so much potential for what comes next and though I am just along for the ride, I look forward to what that ride brings.

		Closing Remarks
	</h2>
	<p>
		Thank you for indulging me and listening to a little bit about me. I hope you were able to learn something or get to know me better! I hope you can stick around and join me for this crazy ride of life and see what other spontaneous or crazy projects I decide to take on. Looking forward to the future!
