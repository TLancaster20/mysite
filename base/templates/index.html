	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
	<p> My name is Anthony Lancaster and I am a fourth year Bachelors of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. This website is a little project for me to work on various coding concepts and help to strengthen my skills as a programmer. I apologize for its current, incomplete state as it is a work in progress. Stick around, and see what progress occurs in the future!</p>
